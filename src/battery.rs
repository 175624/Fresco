//! Battery status for the lock-screen widget (lock-screen aesthetics feature,
//! wave 1 — the daemon-side glue that turns this into a card lands
//! separately, in wave 2; this module only owns the data).
//!
//! # Why sysfs, not UPower
//!
//! `/sys/class/power_supply` works everywhere this needs to: with no D-Bus
//! session bus at all (a lock-screen context may have none), inside the
//! Flatpak sandbox (the filesystem is exposed read-only there; UPower is a
//! *session* service with no such guarantee), and it is what the daemon
//! already reads — see [`on_battery`], which replaces the identical private
//! helper that used to live in `daemon::mod` (~line 1529). Reading the same
//! files as the code it replaces means there is exactly one place that
//! understands this sysfs layout, instead of two copies drifting apart.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! [`read`]/[`read_from`] do the only I/O in this module: one `read_dir` plus
//! a handful of small file reads per entry. Everything they call to interpret
//! those bytes — [`ChargeState`] parsing, the percent/time-remaining
//! aggregation across multiple batteries — is a pure function over
//! already-read strings, exercised below with fake sysfs trees built under
//! `std::env::temp_dir()` (no root, no real battery, no `sudo`).
//!
//! # System battery vs. peripherals
//!
//! `/sys/class/power_supply` also lists **peripheral** batteries: a
//! Bluetooth/USB mouse, keyboard or headset shows up as `hidpp_battery_0` or
//! similar, with the very same `type`/`capacity`/`status` files a laptop
//! battery has. The kernel tags these `scope: Device`; the system's own
//! battery either has no `scope` file at all (the common case) or, on some
//! ACPI backends, `scope: System`. [`read_from`] only aggregates
//! `type == Battery` entries whose scope is **not** `Device` — a lock screen
//! that reported a wireless mouse's charge as the machine's battery would be
//! actively misleading, not just imprecise.
//!
//! [`on_battery`] used to be a **looser**, bug-for-bug port of the daemon's
//! pre-existing quick check that skipped this filtering entirely — see its
//! own doc comment for the regression that shipped and the fix.
//!
//! # Two field families
//!
//! The kernel's battery class exposes energy in one of two unit families,
//! depending on the fuel gauge: `energy_*`/`power_now` in µWh/µW, or
//! `charge_*`/`current_now` in µAh/µA. A given battery only ever reports one
//! family, so every computation here tries the energy family first and falls
//! back to the charge family — never mixes the two, which would need a
//! voltage to convert between them and sysfs does not reliably expose one.

/// plugged-in desktop pausing itself because a wireless mouse's battery is
/// discharging, which it almost always is. Fixed here by routing through
/// [`read`]'s already-correct filter instead of re-deriving a looser one —

/// shares. See the CHANGELOG for the release this landed in.
