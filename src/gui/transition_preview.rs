//! A looping, in-editor demonstration of a wallpaper transition.
//!
//! Given two demo frames (typically the slideshow's first two images) this
//! widget plays the chosen [`Transition`] over and over so the user can see the
//! effect before applying it. Animation is purely client-side: a ~30fps `glib`
//! timeout advances a phase, turns it into per-frame parameters (opacity, slide
//! offset, scale, defocus) and asks a small custom widget, [`Stage`], to
//! repaint. The stage draws both frames itself in `snapshot()` — cover-fit,
//! clipped to its own bounds — so no child widget, CSS filter or
//! `gtk4::Fixed` is involved. No media decoding, no daemon.
//!
//! Why a custom widget: the stage used to be a `Fixed` holding two `Picture`s,
//! and every tick pinned the pictures' minimum size to the stage's own
//! allocation. `Fixed` measures the *transformed* bounds of its children, so a
//! Ken Burns / Zoom / Slide transform pushed the minimum above the allocation,
//! the stage grew, the next tick pinned the pictures even larger, and the whole
//! window ballooned until it covered the screen (issue #31). [`Stage`] now
//! answers a constant from `measure` that depends on neither its content nor
//! its allocation, and the tick only ever calls `queue_draw`, so the enclosing
//! 16:9 `AspectFrame` alone decides the size and nothing can feed back.
//!
//! Everything here is an *approximation* of what the daemon does to the one
//! running mpv player, and the approximations are chosen to be honest about
//! it: the fade dips through black because mpv drives `gamma` and cannot
//! cross-dissolve two files from a single decoder; zoom cuts at the peak of the
//! punch-in because that is where `loadfile` lands; blur softens out and back
//! because the daemon pushes a `gblur` filter and then clears it.
//!
//! The timer runs only while the stage is actually on screen. It used to be
//! armed whenever a transition was picked and to stop only on an explicit
//! [`TransitionPreview::stop`] or once the widget left the tree — and the
//! "left the tree" check sat *behind* a zero-size early return, so a stage
//! that was hidden (a non-slideshow entry's editor, where the frame is
//! invisible but the transition combo still drives this) woke the GUI 30
//! times a second forever. Now the stage's `unmap` removes the timer and its
//! `map` re-arms it, and each tick consults [`gate`] — a pure function, tested
//! below — which ends the loop the moment the stage is unrooted or unmapped
//! and skips the frame's work while the window is minimised. The editor still
//! calls [`TransitionPreview::stop`] explicitly when leaving.
