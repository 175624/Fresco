//! `frescod --saver` — the X11 lock-screen saver module (`docs/plan-lock-screen.md`
//! §4.3/§4.4): draws Fresco's wallpaper into the window a screensaver host
//! hands it, and nothing else.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is deliberately not
//!
//! This is a **saver module**, in the vocabulary xsecurelock and the
//! MATE/Xfce screensaver family both use: a small, dumb renderer that a
//! locker spawns *behind* its own auth surface and kills on unlock. It never
//! grabs input, never sees a password, and never creates a window of its
//! own — it draws into the window `$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW` names, which the
//! host already made and already owns. `xsecurelock`'s own core keeps sole
//! ownership of authentication and the input grab (`docs/plan-lock-screen.md`
//! §4.3); this process has no more access to that than any other unprivileged
//! program on the system.
//!
//! It runs as its own OS process, separate from `frescod` — the host spawns
//! it directly (`saver_child.c`'s `WatchSaverChild`, fetched from
//! xsecurelock's source), not the daemon. That is *why* it talks back to the
//! daemon over the same control-socket IPC the GUI uses
//! ([`crate::ipc::Request::LockNotify`]) rather than through some in-process
//! call: there is no process boundary to cross the other way. And it is why
//! the daemon can only reach this instance's mpv over JSON IPC
//! (`input-ipc-server`) rather than in-process function calls the way the
//! desktop X11 backend drives its own embedded `mpv::Player` — the exact same
//! shape `daemon::mpvpaper::MpvIpc` already drives an external `mpvpaper`
//! child's socket with, just pointed at a socket `frescod --saver` opens
//! instead.
//!
//! # `$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW`: decimal or hex, one process per monitor
//!
//! Verified against xsecurelock's own source (`xscreensaver_api.c`,
//! `env_settings.c`, `helpers/saver_multiplex.c` — all fetched from
//! `github.com/google/xsecurelock`, master branch):
//!
//! - The host always *writes* this as plain decimal (`ExportWindowID`'s
//!   `"%llu"`), but the read side both it and every saver share,
//!   `GetUnsignedLongLongSetting`, parses with `strtoull(value, &endptr, 0)`
//!   — base `0` also accepts a `0x`/`0X` prefix as hex. [`parse_window_id`]
//!   mirrors exactly that (decimal or `0x`-hex; deliberately *not* octal —
//!   see its own doc comment).
//! - xsecurelock's default global saver, `saver_multiplex`, spawns **one
//!   saver process per physical monitor**, each in its own child window
//!   already sized and positioned to that one monitor's geometry
//!   (`SpawnSavers`/`GetMonitors`, built on XRandR — confirmed from
//!   `helpers/monitors.c`'s `#ifdef HAVE_XRANDR_EXT`). It also sets
//!   `$XSCREENSAVER_SAVER_INDEX`, but that is a bare 0-based slot number, not
//!   a connector name — there is no env var naming *which output* a given
//!   saver instance covers. `mate-screensaver`/`xfce4-screensaver` set the
//!   same `$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW` (their `gs-job.c`'s `get_env_vars`, fetched
//!   from each project's source) but run only one saver for the whole
//!   screen, with no per-monitor split at all.
//!
//! So "which screen does this window cover" is answered the only way it can
//! be: by asking X11 what the window's own on-screen geometry is and
//! matching that against Fresco's own RandR monitor list, the same technique
//! `daemon::x11_fullscreen` already uses to match a fullscreen client window
//! to a monitor. See `pick_connector` (private — this module's own internal
//! resolution logic, not part of its public API).
//!
//! # mate-screensaver strips `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; xfce4-screensaver does not
//!
//! A verified, real divergence between the two forks, not a guess:
//! mate-screensaver's `gs-job.c` (`get_env_vars`) builds the saver's
//! environment from a small allowlist — `PATH`, `SESSION_MANAGER`,
//! `XAUTHORITY`, `XAUTHLOCALHOSTNAME`, `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`,
//! `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` — plus `DISPLAY`/`HOME`/`XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW`
//! it sets itself, and that allowlist does **not** include
//! `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. xfce4-screensaver forked the same file and *added*
//! `"XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"` to its own copy of the allowlist. xsecurelock does a
//! plain `fork()`+`execv()` with no custom environment at all
//! (`saver_child.c`), so it passes everything through unchanged. See
//! `runtime_dir` (private) for how this module copes.
//!
//! # Fail-open is not possible from here, by construction
//!
//! This process has no window of its own, no input grab, and no
//! authentication capability — there is no primitive available to it that
//! could ever leave a session unlocked. Its only failure modes are "nothing
//! is drawn" (exit non-zero before a `Player` exists) or "the wallpaper shows
//! but the daemon never hears about it" (a `LockNotify` that could not
//! reach the daemon — always ignored, never retried, never fatal: see the
//! module-level rule that every `crate::ipc::request_with_timeout` call here
//! discards its result).
//!
//! # Signals: xsecurelock's teardown contract
//!
//! xsecurelock kills a saver with `SIGTERM` on unlock
//! (`saver_child.c`/`wait_pgrp.c`'s `KillPgrp(pid, SIGTERM)`, fetched from its
//! source). `SIGINT`/`SIGHUP` are handled the same way defensively, for
//! manual runs and any other host. `SIGUSR1` is deliberately **not** treated
//! as teardown: that is xsecurelock's own "reset the saver" signal
//! (`saver_multiplex.c`'s `HandleSIGUSR1`), sent while the session is still
//! locked — see the private `TERMINATION_SIGNALS` constant.
