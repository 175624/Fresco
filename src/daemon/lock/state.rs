//! Lock-state monitor: merges every source the daemon can observe into one
//! debounced Locked/Unlocked answer.
//!
//! # Sources, and why there are so many
//!
//! No single desktop exposes one reliable "is the session locked" signal, so
//! this module watches all of them and lets [`LockState`] arbitrate:
//!
//! * **COSMIC's lockfile** — `cosmic-greeter` creates
//!   `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cosmic-greeter-$XDG_SESSION_ID.lock` when it starts
//!   locking and removes it on unlock, and — this is the reason it exists at
//!   all in this list — **cosmic-greeter never emits logind's `Unlock`
//!   signal**, so on COSMIC the lockfile is the only authoritative unlock
//!   source. Polled at ≤2 Hz ([`LOCKFILE_POLL`]); no `inotify` (no new
//!   crates, and a plain `stat` every half second is a rounding error next to
//!   the mpv IPC traffic this daemon already generates).
//! * **logind, system bus** — one supervised `gdbus monitor --system --dest
//!   org.freedesktop.login1` child. `Session.Lock`/`Session.Unlock` on *our*
//!   session's object path (resolved once via `Manager.GetSession`, falling
//!   back to `Manager.GetSessionByPID`) and `Manager.PrepareForSleep (true,)`
//!   (system-wide, not session-scoped) are the three signals this module
//!   acts on.
//! * **The session-bus screensaver interfaces** — one supervised `gdbus
//!   monitor --session --dest <interface>` child, where `<interface>` is
//!   whichever of `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver` / `org.gnome.ScreenSaver` /
//!   `org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver` / `org.mate.ScreenSaver` / `org.xfce.ScreenSaver`
//!   matches the detected [`super::hosts::HostKind`] — see
//!   [`screensaver_interface`]. Not spawned at all on a host with no known
//!   interface (COSMIC, a wlroots compositor, a bare X11 WM), so a session
//!   with nothing to watch there opens no extra bus connection.
//! * **IPC and process facts** — `Request::LockNotify` (an out-of-process
//!   renderer reporting its own start/stop), the exit of a host child the
//!   daemon itself spawned (`hosts::RunningHost::child`), and every lock
//!   socket disconnecting. These never arrive through this module's own
//!   children; the daemon's run loops feed them in directly — see
//!   [`LockMonitor::on_lock_notify`], [`on_host_child_exited`](LockMonitor::on_host_child_exited)
//!   and [`on_sockets_disconnected`](LockMonitor::on_sockets_disconnected).
//!
//! # Authoritative-source rules
//!
//! Every source may vote **Locked** — believing "locked" a little too eagerly
//! is the fail-closed direction (a spurious lock vote costs one extra widget
//! swap; a spurious unlock vote could show desktop-only content over a real
//! lock screen). **Unlocked** is stricter: [`LockState`] only accepts it from
//! a source that is actually authoritative for the *current* host —
//! `LockState::vote_for` is the one function that encodes this table:
//!
//! | Host | Authoritative unlock source(s) |
//! |---|---|
//! | COSMIC | lockfile absent — **only** this; see below |
//! | KDE / GNOME / Cinnamon / MATE / Xfce | that host's `ActiveChanged(false)`, or logind `Unlock` |
//! | everything else | logind `Unlock` only |
//!
//! `logind Unlock` is trusted on every host **except** COSMIC. On every other
//! host, this daemon's only way to see the lock's real on-screen state is a
//! bus signal, and logind's own `Unlock` is as good as any of them. COSMIC is
//! the deliberate exception: `cosmic-greeter` paints directly into the same
//! mpvpaper surface this daemon owns
//! (`hosts::LockTargets::Desktop`), so believing a *wrong* unlock there does
//! not just mis-schedule a redraw — it can put desktop-only content
//! (lyrics, an unmasked greeting) on screen while `cosmic-greeter`'s panel is
//! still genuinely up, which is exactly the "desktop-only content over a real
//! lock screen" failure this whole table exists to prevent. `cosmic-greeter`
//! itself never emits `Session.Unlock` — the lockfile is what actually
//! carries this signal in practice — but *something else* calling
//! `loginctl unlock-session` while the greeter is still on screen is exactly
//! the scenario this exception guards against, not a case assumed away.
//!
//! # Debounce, and the one signal that skips it
//!
//! Every vote that disagrees with the current state starts (or refreshes) a
//! [`DEBOUNCE`] timer; the vote only commits once that timer has held for the
//! whole window with no newer, conflicting vote — "no flapping" from a burst
//! of near-simultaneous signals during a real transition. The one exception
//! is `PrepareForSleep(true)`: the plan's own requirement is to "swap widgets
//! immediately so nothing desktop-only is on screen at resume", and a machine
//! can finish suspending within milliseconds of that signal, so it commits
//! **immediately**, bypassing the debounce entirely.
//!
//! # Process supervision
//!
//! [`MonitorChild`] owns one `gdbus monitor` child: a reader thread streams
//! its stdout lines into a channel, [`MonitorChild::poll_lines`] drains
//! whatever has arrived without blocking, and a dead child (exited, or never
//! spawned because `gdbus` is missing) is restarted with exponential backoff
//! the next time it is polled — never inline, never blocking the caller. Every
//! failure degrades: a machine with no `gdbus` still gets the COSMIC lockfile
//! and IPC sources, just not the bus ones.
